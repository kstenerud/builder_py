# Builder.py Project Guide for AI Agents

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based builder wrapper script that automatically downloads, builds, and caches builder executables from various sources (Git repositories, archives, local files). The system acts as a transparent proxy that forwards commands to the appropriate builder executable while managing the underlying complexity of source fetching, building, and caching.

The underlying reason for this wrapper is so that a project can control via `builder.yaml` the exact version of the builder that gets used to build the project. This allows for reproducible builds. The wrapper doesn't concern itself with the actual building; only ensuring the correct version of builder is called.

The intended use is for a copy of `builder.py` to be checked in at the root of a project, along with a `builder.yaml` configuration file that will contain the specific build instructions.

## Critical Design Principles

### üîí **API Stability Contract**
- **ONLY the CLI interface is user-facing and must maintain backwards compatibility**
- **ALL internal Python APIs can change freely without versioning concerns**
- The entire internal class structure, method signatures, and implementation details are implementation details
- Users interact exclusively through command-line arguments

### üìñ **Code Quality Guidelines**
- **Readability > Performance**: This is not on the hot path, so prioritize clear, maintainable code
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one clear purpose
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Avoid tight coupling between components
- **DRY, but not at readability's expense**: Don't abstract just to reduce lines of code
- **Documentation must stay in sync**: Comments and docstrings should reflect actual behavior

### üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Principles**
- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies rather than creating them
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Classes collaborate through composition
- **Fail Fast**: Validate inputs early and provide clear error messages
- **Idempotent Operations**: Repeated operations should be safe (e.g., caching, directory creation)

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

```
BuilderRunner (Orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ProjectConfiguration (Config parsing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PathBuilder (Path management)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TrustManager (Security validation)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CacheManager (Cache operations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SourceFetcher (Source retrieval)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BuilderBuilder (Rust compilation)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CommandProcessor (CLI command handling)
```

### Class Responsibilities

#### **BuilderRunner** - Main Orchestrator
- Coordinates all components to fulfill user requests
- Ensures builder availability through `_ensure_builder_available()`
- Executes builder with `run()`
- **Key Insight**: This is the only class that orchestrates the full workflow

#### **ProjectConfiguration** - Configuration Management
- Parses `builder.yaml` files using regex patterns
- Extracts `builder_binary` URL from YAML content
- **Key Insight**: Uses regex rather than full YAML parser for simplicity and fewer dependencies

#### **PathBuilder** - Centralized Path Management
- All file/directory paths decisions go through this class
- Uses caret-encoding for URL-safe directory names
- Manages cache structure: `~/.cache/builder/executables/[encoded-url]/builder`
- **Key Insight**: Path construction logic is centralized to avoid hardcoded paths throughout codebase

#### **TrustManager** - Security Layer
- Prefix-based trust validation for URLs
- Built-in trusted URL prefixes + user-configurable trust list
- Trust validation happens before any downloads for maximum security
- **Key Insight**: Security validation occurs at the earliest possible point in the workflow

#### **CacheManager** - Cache Operations
- Checks cache validity with `is_builder_cached()`
- Idempotent caching with `cache_builder()`
- Age-based cache pruning (using `<= cutoff_time` for inclusive age comparison)
- Can prune the cache of a specific URL
- **Key Insight**: All cache operations are idempotent and safe to repeat

#### **SourceFetcher** - Source Code Retrieval
- **Public API**: Only `clone_source()` - the unified entry point
- **Private Methods**: All implementation details (Git cloning, archive extraction, file copying)
- Supports: Git repos (with optional references), archives (.zip, .tar.gz, .tgz), local files/directories
- **Key Insight**: Single public method hides complexity while supporting multiple source types

#### **BuilderBuilder** - Rust Project Compilation
- Builds the `builder` binary
- Finds Rust project root by locating `Cargo.toml`
- Builds in release mode with `cargo build --release`
- **Key Insight**: Currently Rust-specific but designed to be extensible

#### **CommandProcessor** - CLI Command Handling
- Processes special commands (trust management, cache operations, help)
- Dispatches commands using strategy pattern
- **Key Insight**: Isolates CLI parsing logic from business logic

## Implementation Details

### Security Model
- **Trust-first approach**: URLs must be trusted before any network operations
- **Prefix-based trust**: Trust applies to URL prefixes, providing granular control
- **Built-in trusted prefixes**: Default safe sources are included
- **User extensible**: Users can add/remove trusted URL prefixes via CLI

### Caching Strategy
- **URL-based keying**: Each unique source URL gets its own cache entry
- **Caret encoding**: URLs are safely encoded for filesystem use
- **Age-based pruning**: Inclusive age comparison (`<= cutoff_time`)
- **Idempotent operations**: Multiple cache operations are safe

### Error Handling
- **Fail fast**: Validate early, fail with clear messages
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue operation when possible (e.g., cache age check failures)
- **User-friendly errors**: CLI errors include suggested solutions

### File Structure
```
~/.cache/builder/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ executables/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [caret-encoded-url]/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ builder (executable)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...

~/.config/builder/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ trusted_urls (user-added trusted URLs)
```

## Testing Architecture

### Test Philosophy
- **Test through public interfaces**: Tests primarily use public APIs, not internal methods
- **Behavior-focused**: Tests validate end-to-end behavior rather than implementation details
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 41 tests covering all major functionality
- **Fast execution**: Test suite runs in ~0.05-0.07 seconds

### Test Structure
- Each class has dedicated test suite
- Integration tests validate component interaction
- Tests are isolated using temporary directories
- Mocking used for external dependencies (subprocess calls, file operations)

## CLI Interface (User-Facing Contract)

### Core Commands
```bash
./builder.py [args...]              # Forward to builder executable
./builder.py --cache-help           # Show cache management help
./builder.py --cache-prune-older-than <time>  # Remove old cache entries
./builder.py --cache-prune-builder [url]      # Remove specific cache entry
./builder.py --trust-yes <url>      # Add trusted URL
./builder.py --trust-no <url>       # Remove trusted URL
./builder.py --trust-list           # List trusted URLs
```

### Time Specifications
- Format: `<positive_integer><unit>`
- Units: `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days)
- Examples: `5m`, `2h`, `30d`

## Configuration File Format

### builder.yaml
```yaml
builder_binary: https://github.com/user/repo.git
# or
builder_binary: "https://github.com/user/repo.git#v1.0.0"
# or
builder_binary: /path/to/local/directory
```

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding Features
1. **Identify the right component**: Which class has the responsibility?
2. **Maintain encapsulation**: Keep internal methods private (prefixed with `_`)
3. **Update tests**: Add tests for new behavior through public interfaces
4. **Update documentation**: Keep docstrings and this file in sync
5. **Consider security**: Does this change affect trust validation?

### When Refactoring
1. **Tests must continue passing**: Behavior should remain unchanged
2. **Maintain CLI compatibility**: Never break the user-facing interface
3. **Update CLAUDE.md**: Document new insights or architectural changes
4. **Check separation of concerns**: Does each class still have a single responsibility?

### Code Style
- Use type hints for all methods
- Document all public methods with docstrings
- Use meaningful variable names
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Keep methods focused and short
- Put print calls for user-facing messages as close to the UI code as possible (in this case, that's usually in CommandProcessor)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå **Breaking CLI Compatibility**
- Never change existing command syntax
- Never remove existing commands
- New commands should follow established patterns

### ‚ùå **Tight Coupling**
- Don't let classes directly instantiate their dependencies
- Avoid calling methods across multiple abstraction levels
- Don't hardcode paths outside PathBuilder

### ‚ùå **Security Bypasses**
- Always validate trust before network operations
- Don't allow trust validation to be skipped
- Trust validation should happen as early as possible

### ‚ùå **Cache Inconsistencies**
- Cache operations must be idempotent
- Cache keys must be deterministic
- Age comparisons should be inclusive (<=)

### ‚ùå **Outdated Documentation**
- Update docstrings when changing method behavior
- Update CLAUDE.md when gaining new architectural insights
- Keep test descriptions accurate

## Key Insights Gained

### **Private vs Public Method Design**
- Initially, many methods were public for granular testing
- **Insight**: Since only CLI is user-facing, internal methods should be private
- **Result**: Cleaner API surface, better encapsulation, tests through public interfaces

### **Cache Pruning Logic**
- Original implementation used `< cutoff_time` for age comparison
- **Insight**: Age comparisons should be inclusive (`<= cutoff_time`) for intuitive behavior
- **Result**: Age=0 properly clears entire cache, exact age matches are pruned

### **Trust Validation Security Model**

- Initially used domain-based trust validation (trust entire domains)
- **Insight**: Domain-based trust creates security vulnerabilities (trusting `github.com` trusts ALL GitHub repositories)
- **Result**: Prefix-based trust validation provides granular control (trust specific users, organizations, or repositories)

### **Security-First Architecture**
- Trust validation was initially scattered throughout the codebase
- **Insight**: Security validation should happen at the earliest possible point
- **Result**: All URLs are validated before any network operations

### **Separation of Concerns Evolution**
- Initially had some classes doing multiple responsibilities
- **Insight**: Each class should have exactly one reason to change
- **Result**: PathBuilder for all paths, TrustManager for all security, CacheManager for all caching

### **Documentation as Architecture Guide**
- Documentation often fell behind code changes
- **Insight**: Documentation drift creates maintenance burden and confusion
- **Result**: This CLAUDE.md file serves as authoritative architecture guide

## Future Considerations

### Potential Extensions
- `builder.py` is intended as a downloader, cacher, and wrapper around the actual builder `builder`, so its future ambitions will be small.
- Integration with other package managers

### Architecture Evolution
- Component interfaces are stable
- Internal implementations can evolve freely
- CLI contract must remain backwards compatible
- Consider dependency injection framework if complexity grows
